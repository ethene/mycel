# Title: Phase 2: Update Android Application ID
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1 (Not found)
# Priority: high
# Description: Change Android application package ID to com.quantumresearch.mycel
# Details:
Update applicationId in briar-android/build.gradle to 'com.quantumresearch.mycel', reset version name to '1.0.0' and version code to 1. Update any references to old package ID.

# Test Strategy:
Verify APK installs as separate application from Briar and package name verification passes using aapt dump badging.
