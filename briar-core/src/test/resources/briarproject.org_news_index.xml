    <summary><![CDATA[Press Release The Briar Project released version 1.2 of its Android app today. This release allows users to add each other securely by exchanging links. Previously users needed to meet in person or ask a mutual contact to introduce them.
Most messenger apps find your contacts by uploading your phone&rsquo;s contact list to a server. Since Briar is designed to protect metadata and contact relationships, it instead uses the Tor network to connect directly and securely to the person you&rsquo;re adding, without revealing your contact list to anyone.]]></summary>
