# Translations for Mycel

**Note**: This project is a rebrand of the original Briar messaging application. The translation infrastructure may reference the original project until new translation systems are established.

## Current Translation Status

The original translations are managed through the Briar project's Transifex:

https://transifex.com/otf/briar

## For New Translations

If you'd like to volunteer as a translator for Mycel:

1. The current translations were inherited from the original Briar project
2. All user-facing strings have been updated from "Briar" to "Mycel" 
3. The core translation keys and structure remain the same

## Translation Files

Translation files are located in:
- `mycel-android/src/main/res/values-*/strings.xml` (47+ language files)

## For Quantum Research

Future translation management may be moved to a new system as the Mycel project establishes its own translation infrastructure independent of the original Briar project.
